I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Architecture, specializing in large-model inference acceleration, intelligent computing systems, and embodied intelligence. I earned my bachelor’s degree from Tsinghua University’s Department of Automation in 2020 under **Professor Tao Zhang**, and completed my Ph.D. in 2025 at the State Key Laboratory of Processors (SKLP) through a joint program between USTC and ICT, CAS, under **Professors Huaping Chen** and **Qi Guo**.

I have published eight papers in top-tier venues, including **TCAD**, **MICRO**, and **ASPLOS**, and am dedicated to advancing intelligent computing through innovative architecture design.
